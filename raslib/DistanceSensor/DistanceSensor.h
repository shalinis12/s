 * @brief High level driver for the GP2Y0A60SZ analog distance sensor.
 * @version 0.1
 * @date 2021-09-27

 * @note
 * GP2Y0A60SZLF Analog Distance Sensor information:
 * This sensor measures the time of flight of an infrared transceiver pair. The
 * time of flight corresponds to a distance value.
 * - Range of measuring distance: 10 cm to 80 cm 
 * - update period: 38.3 Â± 9.6 ms
 * 
 * Available TM4C123 pins for distance sensor: 
 * - PE5, PE4, PE3, PE2, PE1, PE0
 * - PD3, PD2, PD1, PD0
 * - PB5, PB4
 * 
 * Power Specifications:
 * - Supply voltage: 4.5 - 5.5 V
 * - Supply current: ~30 mA
 * - Use your 5V regulator! Do not draw from TM4C.
 * 
 * Pinout:
 * - VCC pin: 5V input line
 * - GND pin: GND input line
 * - OUT pin: Analog output
 * 
 * Summary of driver:
 * - this driver allows you to initialize distance sensors, read an unsigned
 *   16-bit value from the sensors, and set up periodic interrupts where data
 *   is read from a sensor at a desired frequency.
