# Filters! 

Filters are useful if you have noisy data and want to clean it up for more precise data.

Look forward to some basic filter implementations in this library soon...

For now, if you are interested on how filters work and how they can be
implemented, check out this
[c++ implementation for some common filters](https://github.com/dimembermatt/Mbed-Shared-Components/tree/main/src/Filter).
